# seedance-interview-short

This skill transforms a simple idea into a professional, **2000-character** Seedance 2.0 production brief.

## The Workflow

1.  **The Vision**: Single Clip or Narrative Story?
2.  **The Narrative Core**: What is the emotional anchor?
3.  **Visual Layering**: Subject → Action → Environment.
4.  **Technical Precision**: Camera, audio, physics.
5.  **The Final Compressed Brief**: The final output, under 2000 characters, with a live character count.

## The Interviewer's Craft

- Use "Director's Questions" from the [ref:storytelling-framework].
- Keep a running tally of the character budget during the interview.
- Explain the trade-offs of compression to the user.

### Final Output Format

```
**Final Prompt (1850/2000 chars):**

[PROMPT TEXT]

---

**Director's Notes:**
- **Core Intent:** [Summary of emotional goal]
- **Compression Log:** [Note on what was cut to meet the budget]
```
