## Appendix D: Chinese Cinematic & Photography Vocabulary

The model is trained heavily on Chinese-language film production data. Using precise Chinese terminology — or knowing its English equivalent — unlocks more accurate, production-grade results. This appendix is the complete bilingual glossary for Seedance 2.0 directing.

**How to use:** Chinese terms can be used directly in prompts (they carry higher semantic weight). English equivalents are provided for cross-reference and for English-language prompts.
