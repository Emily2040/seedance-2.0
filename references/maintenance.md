### Recipe 10 — Action Transfer (Real Video → Fantasy)

**Delegation level:** 3  
**References:** Self-recorded action video + character face image

**Template:**
```
@Image1's character performs the exact actions from @Video1. Scene: [fantasy/sci-fi environment]. 
Maintain @Video1's motion and camera relationship exactly. Add [VFX: dragons/magic/explosions] to the environment. 
Camera mounted on character, locked-on shot.
SFX: [environment-appropriate sounds].
```

**Tips:** For characters stationary relative to camera (riding/flying), use: `"CAMERA MOUNTED ON [SUBJECT], LOCKED-ON SHOT, FIXED-TO-ACTOR."`
