### Example 2 — Level 2 (Guided Direction, ~60 words)

```
@Image1's character as the subject, placed in @Image2's environment. Reference @Video1's camera movement throughout. 
BGM references @Audio1. A weathered woman in a heavy wool coat stands alone on a rain-slick platform, breath misting. 
Slow dolly push mid-shot to tight close-up over 8s. Single overhead practical as hard key, low-key contrast. 
Anamorphic feel, subtle grain. Sound: soft rain bed, distant train hum; low piano note enters at 2s.

### Example 3 — Level 3 (Time-Segmented, ~90 words)

```
A young mechanic wipes grease from her hands and looks up as the workshop power dies. 
0–3s: fluorescent lights buzz, then flicker out; only a red emergency lamp remains. 
3–7s: she walks toward the open garage door, rain visible in the lamp beam; her silhouette fills the frame. 
7–10s: she stops, hears something outside, holds still. 
Camera: handheld tracking, settles into locked close-up; final frame holds 0.8s. 
Light: red practical key, cool rain spill from outside as rim. 
Sound: rain bed, fluorescent buzz cut at blackout, distant thunder at 6s, silence on last frame.
