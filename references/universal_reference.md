- **Videos:** up to 3 (<50MB each, <15s each)
- **Audio:** up to 3 (MP3, total ≤15s)
- **Total files:** 12 maximum (the "Rule of 12")

### @Tag Assignment (Critical)

Every uploaded asset gets a tag (`@Image1`, `@Video1`, `@Audio1`). **Always assign each tag an explicit role.** A bare tag with no role instruction is weak and leads to misinterpretation.

**How to invoke @Tags:** Type "@" in the input field to see your uploaded assets. Click to insert. Hover to preview and verify you're referencing the correct asset.

### Role Phrases (Copy/Paste Patterns)

**Identity and appearance:**
- `@Image1's character as the subject`
- `@Image1 for facial features and clothing`
- `Use @Image1 and @Image2 for the character's appearance from multiple angles`

**First/last frame:**
- `@Image1 as the first frame`
- `@Image2 as the last frame`

**Scene and environment:**
- `Scene references @Image2`
- `@Image3 as the background environment`

**Costume and props:**
- `Wearing the outfit from @Image3`
- `Holding the weapon from @Image2`

**Camera and motion transfer:**
- `Reference @Video1's camera movement throughout`
- `Fully replicate @Video1's camera movements and transitions`
- `Reference @Video1's action choreography`
- `Imitate the fighting choreography from @Video1`

**Audio:**
- `BGM references @Audio1`
- `Voice timbre references @Audio1`
- `Sync movements with the beat from @Audio1`

**Style transfer:**
- `Match the visual style and color grading of @Video1`
- `Apply @Image1's artistic style to the scene`

### The "Reference" vs. "Edit" Distinction (Critical)

These two phrasings trigger fundamentally different behaviors:

- ✅ **"参考@视频1的运镜" (Reference @Video1's camera movement)** = Generate new content that borrows the technique from the reference.
